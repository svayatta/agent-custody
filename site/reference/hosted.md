# The hosted log

The log at `log.agent-custody.dev` is the reference log server run by us, for teams whose receipts need a signer that is not their own operator. It holds leaf hashes, never receipts. Everything on this page also applies to a log you run yourself from [deploy/](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/tree/main/deploy).

## Plans

| plan | appends a calendar month | price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `free` | 10,000 | $0 |
| `team` | 1,000,000 | $50 a month |
| `enterprise` | no allowance | by conversation |

An append past the allowance is refused:

```
HTTP 429
Retry-After: <seconds to the start of next month>
{ "error": "monthly quota reached: 10000 of 10000 appends on the free plan; it resets at the start of next month, or move to a larger plan" }
```

The gateway's log client retries a 429 three times with backoff and then fails the call: a pre-committed call is withheld, any other returns an error to the agent. Nothing acts without evidence. See [pricing](https://agent-custody.dev/pricing).

## Registering: the portal

`https://app.agent-custody.dev/` is one page. Registering creates the account, the tenant, and its first key, shown once. The page's own API, which any HTTP client may use with the session cookie it sets:

| route | body | response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /auth/github`, `GET /auth/google` | | a redirect to the provider with a signed state in a ten-minute cookie; the callback at `/auth/<provider>/callback` exchanges the code, takes the provider's verified email, links it to the account with that email if that account has verified its address (otherwise the sign-in is refused with a page saying to sign in with the password first), or creates one, sets the session, and shows a page that continues to `/`. With `?link=1` from a signed-in session it links the provider to that account instead, whatever email the provider gives. Offered only when the operator configured the provider |
| `GET /verify-email?token=` | | the link sent at registration: shows a page that posts the token to `POST /api/verify-email`. Opening the link verifies nothing by itself; without the account's own session the page asks the user to sign in with the password first |
| `POST /api/verify-email` | `{ token }` | needs a session whose user is the token's user (else 403); marks the address verified: `{ "ok": true, "emailVerified": true }`. A provider sign-in links to a password account only once this has happened |
| `POST /api/verify-email/resend` | `{}` | sends the verification link again; `{ "ok": true, "emailVerified" }` |
| `POST /api/register` | `{ "email", "password" (10+ chars) }` creates the account only (the page then shows the tenant setup) and sends the verification link, answering `{ "email", "tenant": null, "emailVerified": false }`; with `"tenant"` (3–40 chars, `[a-z0-9-]`), `"name"`, `"company"`, `"role"`?, `"phone"`?, `"telegram"`? as well, the tenant is created in the same call, as before |
| `POST /api/onboard` | `{ "tenant", "name", "company", "role"?, "phone"?, "telegram"? }` | the same response as a one-call register; `409` when the account already has a tenant or the id is taken | `{ "tenant", "logId", "plan": "free", "token": "<64 hex, shown once>", "tokenHash": "<12 hex>", "welcome": "<the welcome sheet>", "setup": { "log", "logId", "checkpoints", "keys", "keyid", "env", "config", "verify", "audit", "export" } (the sheet as data; the page shows it as numbered steps, and again under Setup), "exportCommand": "…" }` and a session cookie; with mail configured, one email to the address with the sheet (never the key) and one to the operator with the contact details; `400` on validation, `409` if the email or tenant is taken, `429` after five registrations from one address |
| `POST /api/login` | `{ "email", "password" }` | `{ "email" }` and the cookie; `401` otherwise; throttled per address. When the account has [MFA](#two-step-sign-in) on: `{ "mfa": true }` and a five-minute `custody_mfa` cookie, and no session. Refused for a member of a tenant that enforces [single sign-on](#single-sign-on) |
| `POST /api/login/mfa` | `{ "code" }` | needs the `custody_mfa` cookie; `{ "email" }` and the session cookie; `401` for a wrong or used code; `429` after five wrong codes for the account |
| `POST /api/mfa/setup` | `{}` | `{ "secret": "<base32>", "uri": "otpauth://…" }`; `409` when MFA is on already |
| `POST /api/mfa/enable` | `{ "code" }` | `{ "mfa": true }` once the code from the new secret is valid |
| `POST /api/mfa/disable` | `{ "code" }` | `{ "mfa": false }` with a current code |
| `POST /api/logout` | `{}` | `{ "ok": true }` |
| `GET /api/me` | | `{ "email", "tenant", "role", "logId", "plan", "used", "quota", "disabled", "billing": true\|false }`; before onboarding, `{ "email", "tenant": null, "profile", "billing" }`; the second also carries `"invites"` (`[{ "tenant", "role" }]`); both carry `"emailVerified"`, `"identities"` (the linked providers), `"providers"` (the ones offered), `"mail"` (whether the portal can send), and `"mfa"` |
| `GET /api/members` | | `{ "members": [{ "id", "email", "role", "joinedAt", "mfa" }], "invites": [{ "email", "role", "invitedBy", "createdAt" }] }` |
| `POST /api/members` | `{ "email", "role" }` | invites the address: `{ "invited", "role" }`; `403` when a non-owner grants `owner` |
| `POST /api/members/<userId>/role` | `{ "role" }` | `{ "role" }`; `403` when a non-owner touches an owner; `409` for the last owner |
| `POST /api/members/<userId>/remove` | `{}` | `{ "removed": true }`; `403` when a non-owner removes an owner; `409` for the last owner |
| `POST /api/invites/remove` | `{ "email" }` | `{ "removed": true\|false }` |
| `POST /api/invites/accept` | `{ "tenant" }` | for an account with no tenant and a verified address: `{ "tenant", "role" }`; `403` for an unverified address, `404` for no invite or one older than seven days, `409` when the account has a tenant already |
| `GET /api/overview` | | `{ "tenant", "logId", "plan", "used", "quota", "treeSize", "rootHash", "latestCheckpoint": { "treeSize", "signedAt" } \| null, "months": [{ "month": "2026-09", "appends": 37 }, …6], "keys": [{ "label", "hash", "createdAt", "revokedAt" }], "audit": [{ "id", "at", "actor", "action", "tenantId", "detail" }], "billing": { "status" } \| null, "urls": { "log", "keys", "checkpoints" }, "exportCommand", "welcome", "setup" (as on register), "stripe": true\|false }` |
| `GET /api/keys` | | `{ "keys": [...] }` |
| `POST /api/keys` | `{ "label" }` | `{ "token": "<shown once>", "tokenHash": "<12 hex>", "label" }` |
| `POST /api/keys/<hash prefix>/revoke` | `{}` | `{ "revoked": 1 }` |
| `GET /api/policies` | | `{ "policies": [{ "id", "name", "digest", "bytes", "createdAt", "createdBy" }] }`; with `?digest=<64 hex>`, `{ "match": <policy> \| null }`: the published version a receipt's `policyDigest` names |
| `POST /api/policies` | `{ "name", "text" }` (the Cedar file byte for byte as the gateway loads it) | `{ "policy": { "id", "name", "digest", … } }`; `409` when that exact text is already published, naming the version |
| `GET /api/policies/<id>` | | `{ "policy": { …, "text" } }` |
| `POST /api/policies/<id>/remove` | `{}` | `{ "removed": true\|false }`; receipts keep their digests, only the name goes |
| `POST /api/checkout` | `{}` | `{ "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/…" }`; `409` if not on `free`; `503` when billing is not configured |
| `POST /api/billing-portal` | `{}` | `{ "url": "https://billing.stripe.com/…" }` |
| `POST /stripe/webhook` | Stripe's event, `Stripe-Signature` header | `{ "received": true }`; `{ "received": true, "duplicate": true }` for an event id applied already; `400` on a bad or stale signature, or an event without `id` and `created`. An event whose `created` is older than the event that set the stored billing state is acknowledged and not applied |
| `GET /health` | | `{ "ok": true, "stripe": true\|false }` |

Every write needs `Content-Type: application/json`; the cookie is `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict`. Every action is in the tenant's audit trail as `portal:<email>`, and plan changes made by Stripe as `stripe:<event>`.

### Roles

Every member of a tenant has one role. A role includes the roles above it in this table.

| role | may |
| --- | --- |
| `readonly` | every `GET` |
| `reviewer` | also publish and remove policy versions |
| `admin` | also mint and revoke API keys, invite, cancel invites, change a member's role, and remove a member, but never touch an owner and never grant `owner` |
| `owner` | everything, billing included |

A write route that is not in this table needs `admin`. The last owner of a tenant cannot be removed or demoted. An invite lasts seven days. An account belongs to one tenant. A removed member loses access at once, also in a tenant with single sign-on. The members page of the portal shows the same operations.

### Two-step sign-in

An account can turn on MFA with a time-based one-time password (TOTP, RFC 6238: 6 digits, 30-second step) from any authenticator app. Setup is `POST /api/mfa/setup`, then `POST /api/mfa/enable` with the first code. After that, a password, GitHub, or Google sign-in ends with a code step, `POST /api/login/mfa`. The `custody_mfa` cookie that the first step sets lasts five minutes and is never a session. A code works once. Wrong codes are throttled per address and per account. An operator turns MFA off for an account that lost its authenticator with `log-admin user mfa-reset <email>` (see [the operator's side](#the-operators-side)).

### Single sign-on

An enterprise tenant can sign in through its own identity provider (IdP). Only the operator sets it up, with `log-admin sso set`. A tenant has OIDC (authorization code with PKCE) or SAML 2.0. A domain belongs to one tenant.

| route | response |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /auth/sso?email=` | finds the tenant that owns the domain of the address and starts its sign-in |
| `GET /auth/sso/<tenant>` | starts the sign-in at the tenant's IdP |
| `GET /auth/sso/<tenant>/callback` | OIDC: exchanges the code, checks the `id_token` signature against the IdP's JWKS (RS256 or ES256 only), the issuer, the audience, the nonce, and the expiry, then signs the user in |
| `GET /auth/sso/<tenant>/saml` | the service provider metadata to give to the IdP |
| `POST /auth/sso/<tenant>/saml/acs` | SAML: reads only the signed assertion, whose bearer `SubjectConfirmationData` must answer the request id in the cookie, then signs the user in |

A sign-in creates the account or links it, and joins it to the tenant with the tenant's default role. The email domain must be one of the tenant's. The IdP proves the address, so a password account that never verified it loses the address: the sign-in deletes that account with its password, sessions, memberships, and linked providers, and a tenant that it created stays for the operator. Registering an address first, with or without a tenant, or linking a provider to it, never blocks the person at the IdP. There are two exceptions. An unverified member of the same tenant signs in with the password and verifies the address first. An unverified member of another tenant that has other members is refused (`403`), so that tenant keeps its members. A removal applies to the email address. A member that an admin removed from the tenant does not rejoin through the IdP on its own, also when the address was never verified. A new account with that address, or a later holder of the same address, is refused too. An admin must invite the address again, and the person then joins with the invited role. The join clears the removal. The portal skips its own MFA, because the IdP owns it. SAML needs the optional package `@node-saml/node-saml` beside the CLI.

With `--enforce`, members of the tenant cannot sign in with a password, GitHub, or Google. The sessions that members had before end. Invites are refused, because members join through the IdP. An owner whose address is not verified cannot sign in then, so each owner must verify the address or sign in through the IdP before you turn enforcement on.

Two emails follow a registration when the operator has mail configured: the setup sheet at once, and about an hour later a personal note from the founder asking which stack the agents are on and offering to do the integration, sent once by an hourly job (`portal-followup`).

## Policies: names for the digests receipts carry

Enforcement is local: the gateway reads its Cedar file and writes the file's SHA-256 into every receipt as `policyDigest`. The portal's Policies page lets a tenant publish each version they deploy under a name, so a digest reads as "refunds-v3" here, in the match tool (paste a receipt or a digest), and in the export's `policies.json`. Nothing on this page is read by the gateway, and the hosted log never evaluates a policy. Every publish and removal is in the tenant's audit trail.

## Using a tenant

The welcome sheet has the three things a tenant needs; in the gateway or SDK config:

```json
"log": { "url": "https://log.agent-custody.dev/t/acme/", "tokenEnv": "AGENT_CUSTODY_LOG_TOKEN", "hashOnly": true }
```

Verifiers add `--log-url https://log.agent-custody.dev/ --log-id acme`, which fetches and pins the published keys and requires the tree heads to be this tenant's. The tenant's routes are the [log API](./log-api) under `/t/acme/`; `leaves`, `usage`, and `audit` there answer only to the tenant's token.

## Taking your data

```bash
npx @agent-custody/receipts log-export --log-url https://log.agent-custody.dev/ --tenant acme --token-env AGENT_CUSTODY_LOG_TOKEN --out custody-export/
```

Writes `log.jsonl` (every leaf hash, in the format `verify --log` and `audit --log` read offline), `head.json`, `keys.json`, `checkpoints.json`, `usage.json`, `audit.json`, and `export.json`, after checking that the head and every checkpoint verify against the published keys and that the leaves hash to their roots. Exit 1 and `RESULT: EXPORT DOES NOT ADD UP` if anything does not. Details under [verify](./verify#log-export).

## The operator's side

For whoever runs a log: `agent-custody log-admin --db-env DATABASE_URL tenant add|list|disable|plan`, `token add|list|revoke`, `audit`, `import`, `user mfa-reset <email>`, `sso set|show|remove`; the admin page at `/admin` (or on its own host, `ADMIN_HOST` in the deployment) behind the admin token with the same operations, the registrations list (who signed up through the portal, plan, billing state, appends this month, leaves in total, with totals and a CSV), usage per tenant per month, a CSV for invoicing, and the activity list. The [runbook](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/blob/main/deploy/RUNBOOK.md) is the operating manual.

Single sign-on for a tenant, set by the operator only:

```bash
agent-custody log-admin --db-env DATABASE_URL sso set acme --oidc-issuer https://idp.example.com --oidc-client-id <id> --oidc-secret-env ACME_OIDC_SECRET --domains acme.com,acme.io --default-role readonly --enforce
agent-custody log-admin --db-env DATABASE_URL sso set acme --saml-entry-point https://idp.example.com/sso --saml-cert idp.pem --saml-idp-issuer <id> --domains acme.com
agent-custody log-admin --db-env DATABASE_URL sso show acme
agent-custody log-admin --db-env DATABASE_URL sso remove acme
```

`sso set` reads the client secret from the named environment variable at that moment and stores it in the portal's table. `--default-role` is the role of a new member (`readonly` if unset, never `owner`). `sso set` replaces the whole setting, so give every flag each time. `--enforce` turns on the rules in [Single sign-on](#single-sign-on). The redirect URI to register at the IdP is `https://<PORTAL_HOST>/auth/sso/<tenant>/callback`. `user mfa-reset <email>` turns MFA off for one portal account; it prints an error when the address has no account. `sso set`, `sso remove`, and `user mfa-reset` write an entry in the audit trail (`sso.set`, `sso.remove`, `user.mfa-reset`) with the actor `cli:<user>@<host>`; the entry never holds a secret. `tenancy.audit()` and `log-admin audit` list it.
