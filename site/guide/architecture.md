# Architecture

How agent-custody is put together, what runs on the customer's side, what runs on ours, and what changes in the agent. The diagrams are the maps; [Deployment](/guide/deployment) says what each setup proves, and [What each piece is for](/guide/pieces) says when to turn each one on.

## The split in one picture

Almost everything runs in the customer's environment. The one thing a customer cannot run for themselves is a log that is not theirs, so that is the only thing hosted. The hosted log holds hashes, not receipts.

| runs on the customer's side | runs on ours |
| --- | --- |
| the gateway, in front of the tools | the log server for each tenant, at `/t/<tenant>/` |
| the gateway key, the principal key, the grant, the Cedar policy, the revocation list | the signer that holds the log's key, apart from the process facing the internet |
| the tool credentials (Stripe key and the like), held by the gateway, not the agent | signed checkpoints on a second host, and the outside monitor |
| the full receipts, with arguments and results, under the customer's capture rules | the tenant portal: registration, tokens, usage against the plan, billing, export |
| the optional memory server and its ledger | the witness software, which must run on a machine the log's operator does not control; no independent operator runs one for our log yet |

A customer who does not want a hosted log runs the same server from the container, the compose file, or the Kubernetes manifests in `deploy/`.

## What the agent has to change

| agent type | change | what you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uses MCP tool servers | name the gateway where the host named the tool server, and remove the direct route | enforcement: a denied call never reaches the tool, and the record is `observed` |
| calls a REST API | describe the endpoints as tools in the gateway config; the credential moves to the gateway | the same, for REST |
| plain function tools | wrap them with the framework adapter, or send them through the sidecar | a record only: every field is `claimed`, because the process describes itself |
| any agent | take tool credentials out of the agent's environment | the gateway cannot be bypassed |

The agent never calls agent-custody. If it holds a credential of its own, nothing here sees what it does with it.

## The data model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Delegation {
        version
        principal
        agent
        scopes[]
        issuedAt
        expiresAt
        agentKey?
        parent?
    }
    class Envelope {
        payloadType
        payload
        signatures[]
    }
    class ReceiptBundle {
        envelope
        treeHead
        inclusion
    }
    class ReceiptStatement {
        subject
        predicateType
        predicate
    }
    class ReceiptPredicate {
        receiptId
        issuer
        principal
        agent
        delegation
        tool
        request
        facts
        policy
        execution
        authorization?
        approval?
        capture?
    }
    class Execution {
        status
        reason?
        result?
        provenance
    }
    class TreeHead {
        treeSize
        rootHash
        timestamp
        log?
    }
    class InclusionProof {
        leafIndex
        treeSize
        hashes[]
    }
    Delegation --> Envelope : signed as DSSE by the principal
    Delegation --> Delegation : parent, narrower sub-grant
    ReceiptBundle *-- Envelope : statement
    ReceiptBundle *-- Envelope : tree head
    ReceiptBundle *-- InclusionProof
    Envelope ..> ReceiptStatement : payload
    Envelope ..> TreeHead : payload
    ReceiptStatement *-- ReceiptPredicate
    ReceiptPredicate *-- Execution
    ReceiptPredicate --> Delegation : the grant chain travels inside
```

Every field of the predicate carries a provenance label: `attested` (signed by a key other than the issuer's), `observed` (the gateway obtained it itself), or `claimed` (the agent said so). [The receipts overview](/receipts/) has the full table.

## One tool call

The order is fixed. A denial at any step still produces a signed receipt, and a tool in `precommit` is authorized in the log before it is forwarded.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent
    participant GW as Gateway (customer side)
    participant Up as Upstream tool
    participant Log as Hosted log
    Agent->>GW: tools/call stripe.refund {customer_id, amount}
    GW->>GW: grant in force? signature, window, not revoked
    GW->>GW: tool in the grant's scopes?
    GW->>GW: approval required and valid?
    GW->>Up: fact lookups, e.g. customer.lookup
    Up-->>GW: result, recorded as observed
    GW->>GW: Cedar policy on args, facts and grant
    alt denied at any step above
        Note over GW: nothing reaches the tool
    else allowed, tool is in precommit
        GW->>Log: append the signed authorization
        Log-->>GW: tree head and inclusion proof
        alt log refuses or is unreachable
            Note over GW: call is withheld, not forwarded
        else log accepted
            GW->>Up: forward the call
            Up-->>GW: result
        end
    else allowed, ordinary tool
        GW->>Up: forward the call
        Up-->>GW: result
    end
    GW->>GW: sign the receipt statement
    GW->>Log: append the leaf hash
    Log-->>GW: signed tree head and inclusion proof
    GW->>GW: write the bundle to receipts/
    GW-->>Agent: result or reason, receipt id in _meta
```

The status the receipt records is one of five:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Checked
    Checked --> denied : grant, scope, approval or Cedar says no
    Checked --> withheld : log would not take the authorization, or grant lapsed before forwarding
    Checked --> Forwarded : allowed
    Forwarded --> executed : upstream answered
    Forwarded --> failed : upstream answered with an error
    Forwarded --> error : upstream unreachable
    denied --> [*]
    withheld --> [*]
    executed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
    error --> [*]
```

## Onboarding a new customer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin as Customer admin
    participant CLI as agent-custody CLI
    participant Portal as Hosted portal
    participant GW as Customer gateway
    participant Log as Hosted log
    Admin->>CLI: keygen, gateway key and principal key
    Admin->>Portal: register, receive tenant and first token (shown once)
    Admin->>CLI: grant --key principal.key --agent --scopes --ttl-hours
    CLI-->>Admin: grant.json, signed by the principal
    Admin->>Admin: write policy.cedar and gateway.json (log url, hashOnly, precommit)
    Admin->>GW: start with the token in the environment
    GW->>Log: first append (log keys fetched and pinned)
    Note over Admin,GW: policy in observe mode first, then enforce
    Admin->>CLI: verify a receipt with the public keys
    CLI-->>Admin: all checks pass
```

## Revoking a grant mid-session

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent as support-agent
    participant Sub as lookup-agent (delegated)
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant File as revoked.json
    actor Op as Operator
    Agent->>GW: stripe.refund
    GW-->>Agent: executed, signed receipt
    Sub->>GW: customer.lookup
    GW-->>Sub: executed, signed receipt
    Op->>File: agent-custody revoke --config --grant
    Note over File: digest of the grant's signed payload appended
    Agent->>GW: stripe.refund
    GW->>File: re-read when it changed
    GW-->>Agent: denied, delegation grant has been revoked, signed receipt
    Sub->>GW: customer.lookup
    GW-->>Sub: denied, the revocation covers every grant delegated from it
```

Revocation is per grant and takes effect on the next call, with no restart and no key rotation. Editing the Cedar policy is separate and is read when the gateway starts.

## Verifying a receipt without trusting the operator

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Auditor
    participant V as Verifier (offline)
    participant Log as Hosted log
    participant W as Witness
    Auditor->>V: receipt bundle, gateway and principal public keys
    V->>V: signature, statement, grant chain, policy digest
    V->>V: inclusion proof places this leaf under the tree head
    Auditor->>Log: fetch the log's published keys
    V->>V: tree head signed by the log's key, expected log id
    opt audit against a kept earlier head
        Auditor->>Log: consistency proof and checkpoints
        V->>V: the log still extends the earlier head
        Auditor->>W: witness countersignature
        V->>V: checkpoint countersigned, no alarm raised
    end
    V-->>Auditor: verified, or the check that failed
```

## What this does and does not cover

- **Only calls through the gateway.** A credential in the agent's environment, a second direct route in the host config, or code that calls an API on its own is outside it. Taking those away is a deployment decision.
- **The SDK and sidecar record, they do not prove.** They run in the process they describe, so their receipts are `claimed`.
- **The hosted log does not see grants or policy.** It sees leaf hashes. A receipt names the grant and carries the policy digest, and a verifier checks both against public keys.
- **The operator can rewrite a local log.** A remote log, published checkpoints, and a witness are what detect that. The witness ships in the package, but a second, independent operator for our log is still being sought, so today the checkpoints are published and the witness step is not yet independent.
- **There is no hosted control plane yet.** Grants, revocation and Cedar policy are managed on the customer's gateway; the portal manages the log, tokens, usage and billing.
- **Policy changes need a restart; grant revocations do not.**
- **Failure mode:** a `precommit` tool is withheld while the log is unreachable. That is deliberate and it is a denial of service on the agent.
- **No transparent egress proxy.** Arbitrary HTTP from agent code is not intercepted.

See [the threat model](/receipts/threat-model) for who could make a receipt false and what stops them, and [the hosted log reference](/reference/hosted) for the log's routes.
