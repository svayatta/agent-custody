# Contributing

This file holds the rules for one area of the code at a time. The rules for every change are in `CLAUDE.md`, the commands are in the root README, the site rules are in `site/README.md`, and the deploy checks are in `deploy/README.md`.

## Files that change together

- `packages/receipts/docs/policies.md` and `packages/receipts/test/docs-policies.test.ts`: the test executes every Cedar example in the guide.
- The `_meta` keys `agent-custody/receipt`, `agent-custody/agent`, and `agent-custody/observed` are in both packages. The state package duplicates them on purpose, to avoid a runtime import. Keep the strings identical.
- The tenant path regex in `packages/receipts/src/log-sink.ts` lists the permitted tenant operations. Add each new tenant route there.
- A new public module goes into the package's `src/index.ts`. A new adapter gets its own `./sdk/<name>` subpath in the `exports` map.
- The portal and admin pages are TypeScript template literals. Inside the page's own JavaScript strings, write a quote as `\\"` in the source. Their tests compile every inline `<script>` with `node:vm`, because one unescaped `\"` makes the page blank.

## Code rules

- Load `node:sqlite` and `pg` with `createRequire`, never with a static import, so that a JSONL user never loads them. `pg` is an optional peer dependency.
- `issue`, `record`, and `handleHookEvent` are asynchronous, because the log may be remote. A log that refuses a leaf is an error, and no bundle is written. Never swallow that error, except where a framework cannot await. There, print it.
- Exporters (`otel.ts`, `splunk.ts`) swallow their failures, so that a collector is never on the evidence path.
- Do not make a data warehouse an event store of the ledger. A warehouse is an export target.
- `--trust-proxy` stays off by default. Only the container sets `TRUST_PROXY=1`, because Caddy fronts it.
- The deploy scripts print ids, never a secret.

## Adapters

- Test each framework adapter against the real package with a scripted model and no network. A hand-written stand-in alone is not sufficient. The Python tests follow the same rule: they run with `uv run --extra test pytest` against a sidecar started from `packages/receipts/src/cli.ts`, and the TypeScript verifier checks every receipt that they produce.
- Drive each host's documented hook contract as the host drives it. The Claude Agent SDK adapter is the precedent.
- An enforcing adapter blocks the call on a deny after it issues the denial receipt. It also blocks the call when it cannot issue the receipt. The OpenClaw `before_tool_call` hook in `src/sdk/openclaw.ts` is the reference.
- A record-only adapter evaluates no policy. On one tool, an adapter enforces or observes, never both.
- Every adapter calls `denies(policy)` (TypeScript in `sdk/index.ts`, Python in `agent_custody`) before it blocks, so that it never acts on a recorded deny. Observe mode stamps `enforced: false` on a Cedar `PolicyDecision` only. A grant denial (out of scope, expired, revoked) is enforced in every mode (issue #97).
- DeepSeek Harness: `tools/pre-execute` returns `{ kind: "deny", reason }` or `next()`, never `allow`. `Config` is a zod schema, because Cordis requires Standard Schema. A post-execute for a tool that the policy denies records deny and executed, and verification fails. This is correct, because the pre gate runs first in the harness.
- CrewAI: `agent_custody/crewai.py` builds a `CustodyTool` subclass instance that delegates to the original tool's `_run`. Replacing `_run` on a pydantic tool instance has no effect.
- Muse (muse.ai) has no hook surface. Do not build an adapter for it: a connector provider fronts its own API with the gateway.
- Python needs 3.10, because the `mcp` client needs it. Both mcp 1.x and 2.x work. The mcp result flag in Python is `is_error`. `bun run test:python` runs `bun run build` first, because the memory tests need it. The `crewai` extra is large.

## Security invariants

Do not weaken an invariant to make a test pass.

Gateway and receipts:

- The gateway checks the grant on every call and again just before the forward (then `withheld`). A revocation file that it cannot read makes it deny every call, never throw.
- A grant digest is a sha256 over the signed payload, so a repacked envelope keeps its digest. Revoking any link of a delegation chain revokes the grants below it.
- Over HTTP, a grant failure answers 403 with the reason before any session exists. Do not use 401: the MCP client transport treats 401 as an OAuth challenge. A session whose grant expires or is revoked closes on its next request.
- `precommit`: when the authorization append fails, the call is `withheld` and nothing goes upstream. `httpLog` believes no append answer that it has not checked (issue #99). The gateway config refuses `precommit` with a remote log and no `log.keys`.
- A financial operation id is the agent's text. A private capture rule withholds `operation.id`, and a reconciliation lookup template cannot copy it; receipts link by the gateway-derived `idempotencyKey`. A reconciliation receipt is not a policy-allowed call of the tool: the exporters (`otel.ts`, `splunk.ts`) mark it and carry no policy decision for it. `reconcile` releases a reservation only after a receipt reached the log, and treats a creator PID as alive unless its start time shows another process (the `ps` fallback pins `TZ=UTC`). The authorization save before a financial forward is a compare-and-set (`saveAuthorization`), so a wrong liveness answer never lets a closed call go out.
- The verifier accepts a deny beside an executed call only when the receipt carries `enforced: false` (observe mode).
- An upstream signature covers `{ content, isError }` only, never `_meta`.
- `serveA2a` drops the `signatures` of the card that it serves, because the rewritten card no longer matches them.
- The gateway never reads published policies.
- A captured side is the fields the rule keeps in clear beside one commitment at `$rest` over the rest, never field by field: a field name is chosen by the agent or the upstream like a value, and field by field would put the names in the view and in the signed note. A fact's lookup arguments are the exception, field by field, since their names are the fact config's. The provider's bound value must appear in what the agent received (`content`, `isError`, `structuredContent`), never in the delivery's own copy in `_meta`.
- `capture` rules (`src/capture.ts`) are applied in one place: `createIssuer` runs `privateView` over the whole predicate before it signs, logs, writes, or exports anything, the authorization included. Producers hand the issuer the call in full and never pre-apply a rule. The policy decides on the real values, the agent gets the real result, error, and reason, and the digests and signatures are over the whole call.
- Under a private rule, what stays in clear is the allowlist in `capture.ts` (`CLEAR_TOP`, `CLEAR_IN`): ids, key ids, timestamps, the tool, the grant, the digests, the decision and policy ids, the status, the provenance fields, the note. Everything else is withheld: a side the rule does not set, policy error messages, a denial reason, a thrown message, the result's `_meta` (never in clear, even if listed, and withheld beside a result the rule leaves in clear), a provider delivery's body and an upstream's signed envelope (upstream-authored, withheld under any private rule, not only a private result), the fact ids an upstream declared it served (`consumed.factIds`), a provider's signature and bind (the signature is a MAC over the withheld body), the session and model ids (supplied by the agent's call or process), a tool name no upstream offers (`effectiveRule` combines the name's rule and the wildcard side by side, the more private mode and the intersection of the clear lists, since the name is the agent's text and a mode does not order which fields are public; the gateway and the issuer both call it, so the fact arguments kept in clear and the view agree; the view shows `(unknown tool)`: `CaptureContext.unknownTool`, never a renamed predicate), and any field added later. Beside a result the rule leaves in clear, an upstream envelope that is exactly the plain attestation for this call (`isPlainAttestation`: every envelope and signature-entry field, canonical bytes, bound to this receipt, tool, and result) stays, anything else is withheld, and the verifiers fail the upstream check for a withheld envelope beside a clear result rather than skip it. The SDK trusts the tool name the application gives it. A reader of a receipt that withholds a part it needs says so: `blast`, `explain`, and the packs list such calls as `withheld` (`INCOMPLETE` in their reports), never as having consumed nothing, bounded by the assert's transaction time, not `validFrom`. The test of what may stay in clear: the issuer, the grant, or the config produced it, never the agent's call, an upstream, or a provider.
- Both verifiers run `structural parts in clear` before anything else: the capture note must be well formed and may not name a structural part, and the parts every check reads must be of the right type; a crafted issuer cannot hide the status, the tool, the decision, or a digest behind a commitment and still verify (vectors `resigned-status-withheld`, `resigned-tool-withheld`, `resigned-delegation-withheld`, `resigned-note-malformed`, `resigned-note-path-string`).
- An encrypted commitment is bound (AES-GCM additional data) to its receipt id and path, so a ciphertext moved to another receipt or path does not decrypt; `reveal` requires `--issuer-key` and verifies the bundle before decrypting anything, writes `--out` owner-only through a file it opens itself (no symlink), and the issuer writes the salts only once the log has taken the leaf. `prune` removes the authorization file with the receipt. The issuer checks the salts directory before it signs or appends anything, keeps an authorization's view until the log has taken the receipt (a retry after a refusal gets the same commitments), and lets it go after an hour. `reveal` and `verify` fail, naming the key id, when the values are encrypted under another key. A `$rest` is folded back only where a side was captured as one; a fact argument named `$rest` is an argument. Both verifiers look structural names up by own property. The Splunk event never carries a commitment. Add a field to the allowlist only if it can never carry a value from the call. `isError` on a result is the status and stays in clear.
- A fact lookup's arguments follow the call's `args` side: the gateway tells the issuer (`CaptureContext.clearFactArgs`) which fact arguments are constants or copy a call argument the rule keeps in clear, from the fact config that was used, because fact names are not unique across tools; the issuer withholds every other fact argument.
- No salt is ever in a receipt. `withhold` returns the salt to the issuer, which keeps the salts of digest-only commitments in `receipts/salts/<id>.json` (0600 in a 0700 directory, never signed, never exported, pruned with the receipt); an encrypted commitment carries its salt inside the ciphertext with the value, and that salt is not written anywhere else. Under a private rule a fact's `resultDigest` is a commitment to the lookup's full result (the gateway passes it as `CaptureContext.factResults`), never an unsalted digest: the receipt shows only the selected value and the rest of the result is private whatever the selected fields are; a producer that does not pass the full result gets the digest string withheld instead. `reveal --out` writes 0600 and chmods an existing file. A result's `isError` stays in clear only when it is a boolean: an SDK tool may return anything under that name. A receipt id from a bundle or a log line is checked (`RECEIPT_ID`) before it becomes part of a path. Tool and fact names are looked up by own property (`ruleFor`, `ownOf`): a tool named `constructor` gets the wildcard rule, never an inherited member. A digest over a part with withheld values is salted from those values' salts (`digestSalt`), so whoever can restore the values can recompute it and nobody else can confirm a guess; the gateway passes the lookups' full results (`CaptureContext.factResults`) so the fact digests can be. The authorization and the receipt of one call carry the same commitments and salts: the issuer keeps the authorization's view and salts by receipt id and reuses them when the receipt is issued, or the receipt would no longer name the authorization.
- `test/capture-canary.test.ts` is the gate for this feature: a secret in the withheld arguments, an upstream that repeats it everywhere, every path through the gateway and the SDK, the decoded statements, authorization, files, log, and exporters checked, with a control that finds it. A new path a call can take, or a new place a receipt can carry a value, goes into that test.

Verifier (`src/verify.ts` and its mirror `site/verifier/verify-web.ts`):

- `canonicalize` builds null-prototype objects, so that an own property named `__proto__` (which `JSON.parse` produces) stays in the digest (issue #102; vector `gateway-executed-proto-key`).
- `verifyBundle` recomputes `execution.resultDigest` on executed and failed receipts: the check `execution result digest` (issue #104; vector `resigned-result-digest`).
- `delegation valid at receipt time` passes a denied or withheld receipt that was issued after the grant window. Only an executed call must be inside the window.
- `delegation chain to the principal` runs when the grant embeds a parent, and walks the chain to the principal's key.
- The signed capture note decides what is withheld (`restorePaths(predicate, note, disclosed?, key?)`): a path the note names must hold a commitment, and commitment-shaped data at a path it does not name is data. `request args digest` and `execution result digest` are recomputed, with the statement's salts, when every value under them is in clear, disclosed, or decrypted, and otherwise pass as committed; `fact <name> value`, `fact <name> args`, and `withheld <path>` report every other named path; a contradicting disclosure fails with the path named, and a disclosure for another receipt fails `disclosure names this receipt`. Both verifiers agree (vector `resigned-body-note-without-commitment`).
- A commitment is one only when it is well formed (`isCommitment`: the sha256 and the salt, and the encrypted fields for that variant); a tag alone never excuses a digest (vector `sdk-malformed-commitment-resigned`).
- A disclosure carries `{ $custody: "disclosed", salt, value }` at each path; a value without its salt is refused, since it cannot be checked, and a salt without its value is refused too, since handed over it would let a reviewer confirm guesses (`reveal` writes such entries only with `--include-salts`). The dictionary regression in `test/capture.test.ts` ("a reviewer who can guess a withheld value cannot confirm the guess") guards #126 in both modes. The salts file is written 0600 in a 0700 directory, is as sensitive as the values, and in mode `digest` is the only copy of each salt.
- A verifier skips an upstream check only for a part the signed note declares withheld and it could not restore; evidence that is missing, or commitment-shaped without the note saying so, fails the check (vector `gateway-undeclared-envelope-commitment-resigned`).

Memory:

- The memory server believes `_meta` only from a caller known to be the gateway. It drops a direct caller's `_meta` whole (issue #95). Gateway tokens and direct-writer tokens are different, and `serve --http` refuses to start without `--token-env`.
- Memory write order is validate, stores, ledger. Retract order is ledger, then stores.
- A store without `verifyRemoved` is `unverified`, never `verified`. Without a ledger, the explain belief questions read "unknown without a ledger", never "nothing". Receipts inside a custody pack keep the values they recorded, by design.
- `selectAbout` and `selectFor` in `packages/state/src/storage.ts` are the reference semantics. The SQL stores must match them. The ledger suite runs on JSONL, SQLite, and Postgres; a store change is wrong if any backend diverges. `PostgresStore` never closes a client that it was given.

Web pages and the hosted log:

- The review pages, the portal, and the admin page load no outside content. Each sends a content security policy that starts with `default-src 'none'`.
- The review server has no authentication of its own and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Keep that default.
- The portal session cookie is `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict`, and every portal API write requires a JSON body. Together they stop a cross-site page from acting as the user.
- The portal reads Google's id token without a signature check, because the token arrives from Google's token endpoint over TLS in the same code exchange. Do not read an id token from any other source this way.
- The portal links a provider sign-in to a password account only when the account's email is verified (issue #103). The Stripe webhook checks `Stripe-Signature` and never touches an enterprise tenant. It ignores an event id that it applied already, and an event older than the last one applied (issue #105).
- Single sign-on is set by the operator only (`log-admin sso`), never through a portal route. A domain belongs to one tenant, and an IdP is trusted only for its tenant's domains.
- The `id_token` of an SSO IdP is checked for its signature against the IdP's own key set (RS256 and ES256 only), then for issuer, audience, nonce, and expiry. The Google exception above does not extend to it.
- For SAML, read only the signed assertion. Its bearer `SubjectConfirmationData` must answer the request id that the sign-in cookie holds. Never verify an XML signature by hand: use the library.
- An MFA code is single use. The `custody_mfa` cookie is never a session. An SSO sign-in skips the portal's MFA only because the IdP owns it.
- A new portal write route needs the `admin` role unless the role table in `site/reference/hosted.md` lists it. An admin never touches an owner or grants `owner`. The last owner stays.
- Every path under `/admin`, the page included, needs the admin token. The admin routes throttle failed attempts per address.
- `Verifier.vue` fetches only receipt ids that match `^[0-9a-f-]{36}$`, and only files under `/custody/` on its own origin.
- The log rate-limits each token and caps the request body (64 KiB by default). A tenant route answers only to that tenant's token.
- The log stores tenant tokens as sha256 hashes, never as plain text. An audit row never holds a token.
- The witness must not run on the log operator's machine.

## Tests

- Each package's `vitest.config.ts` sets a 30-second test budget and a 60-second hook budget, because tests spawn gateways and load PGlite. A test that needs longer says so in its own `it(..., ms)`.
- `.githooks/pre-push` runs `bun run ci` before a push to main. Enable it once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. A fresh clone has no hook until you do this.
- When a gate run and the pre-push hook run back to back, the second one runs under load. Do not pack or build while either runs.
- Tests use `node:http` stand-ins, or real client packages against fake endpoints. Set `MEM0_TELEMETRY=false` so that the Mem0 client stays offline.
- `packages/state/test/pgvector.test.ts` runs against the `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image in Docker, and skips visibly when no daemon runs. PGlite 0.5.8 has no pgvector.
- A test that runs a language client synchronously must not host the sidecar in-process, or the client hangs. A missing toolchain skips its language visibly.

## Release and publish

- Pack with `bun pm pack`, not `npm pack`, so that `workspace:*` dependencies become versions.
- To bump: change the three package versions, the two `"version"` fields in `packages/receipts/server.json`, and the two workspace `"version"` lines in `bun.lock`. Edit the `bun.lock` lines by hand. A blanket search-and-replace of the old version string also changes every dependency pinned at the same string (for example `@electric-sql/pglite` 0.5.8), and `bun install --frozen-lockfile` then hangs silently. Never delete and regenerate the lockfile: that re-resolves every dependency and can break vitest.
- To publish: `bun run build`, then `bun pm pack` in the package directory, then `npm publish <tarball> --access public` from a terminal with `NPM_TOKEN` set (a granular token with the 2FA bypass; the gitignored project `.npmrc` reads it). Publish receipts before state. Then run the `mcp-registry` workflow (Actions tab).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs its check job on every tag. Its npm and PyPI jobs run only when the repository variable `PUBLISH_FROM_CI` is `true`. Set it when trusted publishing is configured on both registries.
