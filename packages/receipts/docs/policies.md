# Writing policies

Policies are written in [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/), the language AWS uses for AgentCore and Verified Permissions. There is no home-grown policy language here. Every example on this page is executed against the real evaluator in the test suite.

## How a tool call becomes a Cedar request

For an intercepted call to tool `T` by the agent named in the grant:

| Cedar slot | value |
| --- | --- |
| `principal` | `Agent::"<agent id from the grant>"` |
| `action` | `Action::"<T>"` |
| `resource` | `Tool::"<T>"` |
| `context.args` | the call's arguments, exactly as the agent sent them. **Provenance: claimed.** |
| `context.facts` | results of the gateway's own upstream lookups configured in `facts`. **Provenance: observed.** |
| `context.grant` | `{ principal, scopes }` from the signed delegation. **Provenance: attested.** |

No entity hierarchy or schema is loaded yet, so policies reason about `context` and the three identifiers above.

Two things happen before Cedar runs and cannot be overridden by policy:

1. If `T` is not in the grant's scopes, the call is denied. No facts are fetched.
2. Each configured fact for `T` is fetched from upstream. If any lookup fails, the call is denied.

## The rules Cedar applies

- **Default deny.** With no matching `permit`, the decision is deny.
- **`forbid` wins.** A matching `forbid` overrides every `permit`.
- **Errors deny.** If evaluating any policy raises an error, such as a missing attribute or a float, the gateway denies regardless of what other policies said. The errors are recorded in the receipt.
- **The policy is pinned.** The receipt carries the sha256 of the policy file, so a verifier knows which text produced the decision.

## Examples

Each of these is a complete, valid policy file.

**Permit a read to any agent holding the scope.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"customer.lookup", resource);
```

**Cap an amount.** Amounts are integer minor units. 100000 pence is £1,000.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource)
when { context.args.amount <= 100000 };
```

A call without `amount` is an error, hence a deny. That is the behaviour you want from a payments policy.

**Require a fact the gateway fetched, not something the agent asserted.** This is the pattern the whole project exists for.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource)
when {
  context.args.amount <= 100000 &&
  context.facts has customer &&
  context.facts.customer.verified == true
};
```

With the matching `facts` entry in the gateway config, `context.facts.customer` is whatever `customer.lookup` returned for the customer id in the call. An agent that sends `{ "verified": true }` in its arguments changes nothing, because the policy never reads `context.args.verified`.

**Restrict to a named agent.**

```cedar
permit(principal == Agent::"support-agent", action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource);
```

**Several tools in one rule.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action in [Action::"customer.lookup", Action::"customer.search"], resource);
```

**A hard block that no permit can override.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource)
when { context.args.amount <= 100000 };

forbid(principal, action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource)
when { context.facts has customer && context.facts.customer.flagged == true };
```

**Pattern-match a string argument.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"github.merge", resource)
when { context.args.repo like "acme/*" && context.args.base == "main" };
```

**`unless` reads better for exceptions.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"stripe.refund", resource)
unless { context.args.currency != "GBP" };
```

**Reach the grant itself.**

```cedar
permit(principal, action, resource)
when { context.grant.principal == "user_456" };
```

## Policies for memory

The memory server in `@agent-custody/state` is an upstream like any other, so its tools are governed by the same policy file with the same request shape. What differs is what is in the context:

| for | `context.args` carries | `context.facts` can carry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory.write` | `subject`, `predicate`, `value`, `space`, and optionally `supersedes` and `evidence` | `target`, the fact being superseded, when the gateway is configured to look it up with `memory.get` |
| `memory.read` | the query, and `includeClaimed` or `requireVerified` when the caller asks for them | |
| `memory.retract`, `memory.forget`, `memory.hold`, `memory.release` | `factId` and `reason` | `target`, the fact being changed |
| `memory.sweep` | `before`, `space`, `reason` | |
| `memory.repair` | `reason`, and optionally `before` (an earlier cutoff) | |
| `memory.confirm` | `factId` | |

A looked-up `target` has `space`, `actor`, `provenance` (`claimed`, `attested`, or `verified`), `subject`, `predicate`, `value`, and `retracted`. Fields that would be null are absent, so test with `has`. The lookup config that makes `target` available is in the [state package README](../../state/README.md#the-memory-server).

**Confine an agent to its team's space.** Reads anywhere, writes only to one space.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.read", resource);
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.write", resource)
when { context.args.space == "team:support" };
```

**Keep quarantine closed.** Only a named reviewer may read claimed facts or lift them out of quarantine.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.read", resource)
unless { context.args has includeClaimed && context.args.includeClaimed == true && principal != Agent::"reviewer" };
permit(principal == Agent::"reviewer", action == Action::"memory.confirm", resource);
```

**Require evidence for org memory.** A write to the org space must cite a fact the gateway fetched itself; the memory server then checks the value against it and writes it as verified, or refuses.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.write", resource)
when { context.args.space != "org" || context.args has evidence };
```

**Protect attested org facts from being displaced or retracted.** Needs the `target` lookup. A self-reported org note can be replaced; an attested one cannot.

```cedar
permit(principal, action in [Action::"memory.write", Action::"memory.retract"], resource);
forbid(principal, action in [Action::"memory.write", Action::"memory.retract"], resource)
when { context.facts has target && context.facts.target.space == "org" && context.facts.target.provenance == "attested" };
```

**Erasure and holds belong to named roles.** Everyone else is denied by default.

```cedar
permit(principal == Agent::"privacy-officer", action in [Action::"memory.forget", Action::"memory.sweep"], resource);
permit(principal == Agent::"legal", action in [Action::"memory.hold", Action::"memory.release"], resource);
```

**A complete policy for a support agent.** The pieces above, together: read anywhere but not into quarantine, write team memory freely, write org memory only with evidence, retract only claimed facts, and no erasure or holds at all.

```cedar
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.read", resource)
unless { context.args has includeClaimed && context.args.includeClaimed == true };
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.write", resource)
when { context.args.space == "team:support" || (context.args.space == "org" && context.args has evidence) };
permit(principal, action == Action::"memory.retract", resource)
when { context.facts has target && context.facts.target.provenance == "claimed" };
```

## Gotchas

- **Integers only.** `12.50` is not a Cedar value. Send `1250`.
- **Test `has` before reading an optional attribute.** `context.facts.customer.verified` errors if there is no `customer` fact, and an error is a deny. Sometimes that is what you want. When it is not, guard with `context.facts has customer`.
- **No schema means no typo protection.** A policy that reads `context.args.ammount` never matches and every refund is denied. Fail-closed hides typos as denials, so test your policies.
- **Scope is enforced outside Cedar.** You cannot use a policy to grant a tool the delegation did not include.

## Testing a policy

The evaluator is a pure function, so a policy test is a unit test. See [test/policy.test.ts](../test/policy.test.ts).

```ts
import { evaluate } from "../src/policy.ts";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const policy = readFileSync("policy.cedar", "utf8");
const d = evaluate(policy, {
  agentId: "support-agent",
  tool: "stripe.refund",
  context: {
    args: { customer_id: "cust_123", amount: 50000 },
    facts: { customer: { verified: true } },
    grant: { principal: "user_456", scopes: ["customer.lookup", "stripe.refund"] },
  },
});
// d.decision  "allow" | "deny"
// d.reasons   ids of the policies that decided it
// d.errors    evaluation errors, non-empty always means deny
// d.policyDigest  sha256 of the policy text, the same value a receipt will carry
```

Write one case per branch of every `when` clause, plus one for the missing-attribute path.

## Simulating a policy against recorded history

Use `policy simulate` before enforcing a tighter policy. It verifies local receipt bundles with your public keys, then evaluates the proposed Cedar text against the arguments and fact values each receipt recorded at call time. Gateway receipts also supply the principal and scopes from their signed delegation as `context.grant`; SDK receipts keep their original context of `args` and `facts: {}`. Replay runs offline, without fetching new facts or executing tools.

```bash
agent-custody policy simulate --policy proposed.cedar --receipts receipts \
  --issuer-key keys/gateway.pub --principal-key keys/principal.pub \
  --out simulation.json
```

For SDK receipts, use the application's public key as `--issuer-key`; no principal key is needed. Add `--log-key keys/log.pub` when another key signed the log's tree heads. Add `--approval-key keys/approver.pub` when the history holds calls that a human approved: `verify` needs those keys for a forwarded call that carries an approval, and the command fails without them. Each key flag may be repeated when the history spans several keys. The directory is read in filename order, without recursion, one bundle at a time, so it never holds the tool results of the whole history in memory. A malformed or unverifiable bundle, or invalid Cedar syntax in the proposed policy, fails the command.

A gateway that dies after it forwards a `precommit` call leaves `<id>.authorization.json` and no `<id>.json`. The command verifies each such file as an authorization statement (the issuer key, the tree head, and the inclusion proof) and lists the call under `skipped`, so the report is `INCOMPLETE`. An authorization that does not verify fails the command. An authorization that sits beside its receipt is not read twice.

The command also checks that each `<id>.json` holds receipt `<id>`. A receipt under another file name fails the command, so a copy over the name of another receipt cannot hide that call.

A receipt under a capture rule needs its withheld arguments and fact values to replay. Give `--capture-key-env NAME` to decrypt the values that mode `encrypted` withheld, as `verify` does. Give `--disclose <file>`, which you can repeat, for the values that mode `digest` withheld. Each file is a disclosure as `reveal` writes it, and it applies only to the receipt that its `receiptId` names. A key or a disclosure that does not match a commitment skips that receipt as malformed. The key comes from the environment, never from a flag value.

The report lists every call whose `allow` or `deny` decision changes, grouped by tool and the proposed decision's policy ids or evaluation errors, with the receipt ids and both decisions. A call executed in observe mode may already have a recorded deny: replay compares that recorded decision, not whether the tool ran. Calls with the same decision stay unchanged even when different policy ids match. Cedar evaluation errors remain denials.

Every run records a `runId`, `timestamp`, the proposed text's sha256 as `policyDigest`, and the original digests as `previousPolicyDigests`. `--out` saves the full JSON report, and `--json` prints it to stdout. Changes alone exit 0. A report that cannot replay every call says `INCOMPLETE` and exits 1: `skipped` names each receipt and why. This includes record-only receipts with no policy baseline, withheld arguments or fact values, calls whose receipt is missing, and calls stopped before Cedar could evaluate. Grant failures cannot become permits through a policy change, and neither can an approval refusal: the gateway checks the approval before Cedar runs, so the call is skipped as a non-policy gate. The approval record says so even under a private rule. Withheld results alone do not prevent replay. A reconciliation receipt is a provider read, so no policy decision exists to replay. The report counts it in `reconciliations`, not in `evaluated` or `skipped`, and it does not make the report incomplete.

The report is an analysis of the supplied receipt directory; it does not prove that the directory contains the whole history. Keep the report beside the proposed policy and review the changed receipt ids before switching from observe mode to enforcement. [Tutorial 28](../examples/28-policy-simulation.ts) records three refunds, stops the gateway, and replays them against a lower limit.
