# agent-custody

Chain of custody for AI agents: a signed receipt for every tool call, checkable with public keys alone. What each check proves, and against whom, is [a table below](#what-a-receipt-proves-and-what-it-does-not).

Two producers, one receipt format, one verifier.

- **The gateway** is an MCP proxy between an agent and the systems it can affect: MCP servers, REST APIs described as tools, and other agents it delegates to over A2A. For every tool call, allowed or denied, it checks a delegation grant signed by the human principal, gathers the facts the policy needs by calling upstream itself, evaluates a Cedar policy that fails closed, forwards the call only on allow, and emits a signed receipt appended to a Merkle transparency log.
- **The SDK** is an interceptor inside the agent's own process, hooked into the framework's tool-call callbacks: Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, the OpenAI Agents SDK, the Vercel AI SDK, OpenClaw, DeepSeek Harness, Hermes, Google ADK, LangChain, or any function you wrap. It reaches everything the gateway cannot see and issues the same receipts, labelled as self-reported.

Anyone holding the public keys can verify a receipt offline. The agent is not trusted. The layer around it is, and the receipt says exactly how far that trust extends, starting with who issued it.

- [Reference](https://docs.agent-custody.dev/reference/): every function, endpoint, MCP tool, and command with its request and response
- [Tutorials](docs/tutorials.md): twenty-five runnable examples, one per aspect of the code, all executed by the test suite
- [Usage guide](docs/usage.md): gateway setup, wiring into Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or your own agent loop, and the gateway as an A2A agent between agents that delegate to each other
- [The interceptor SDK](docs/sdk.md): Claude Code hooks, the Claude Agent SDK, adapters for the OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, OpenClaw and DeepSeek Harness, a Hermes Agent plugin and Google ADK callbacks through the Python package, and wrapping tool functions in anything else
- [Writing policies](docs/policies.md): how a tool call becomes a Cedar request, with tested examples
- [Verifying a receipt](docs/verification.md): what each check means and what a verified receipt does and does not prove
- [What the evidence satisfies](docs/compliance.md): the receipts, packs, and certificates mapped to SOC 2, ISO 27001, the EU AI Act, and UK GDPR, with what none of them claims
- [Threat model](docs/threat-model.md): every party who could make a receipt false, the move, what stops it, and whether that is a property of the evidence or of the deployment; and what is not defended

## Getting started

```bash
npm install @agent-custody/receipts        # or bun add, pnpm add
```

Published on npm as [`@agent-custody/receipts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agent-custody/receipts): compiled JavaScript with type declarations, Node 22 or later, Apache-2.0.

Record receipts from inside your own agent, no gateway needed. Generate a signing key, point a config at it, wrap the functions the agent calls:

```bash
npx agent-custody keygen --dir keys --name app
```

```json
{ "agentId": "billing-bot", "identity": { "keyFile": "keys/app.key" }, "receiptsDir": "receipts", "logFile": "log.jsonl" }
```

```ts
import { createSdkIssuer, loadSdkConfig, loadPublicKey, verifyBundle } from "@agent-custody/receipts";

const issuer = createSdkIssuer(loadSdkConfig("./sdk.json"));
const refund = issuer.wrap("stripe.refund", async (args: { amount: number }) => stripe.refund(args));
await refund({ amount: 5000 });                 // one signed receipt in receipts/, one leaf in log.jsonl

const bundle = JSON.parse(readFileSync("receipts/<id>.json", "utf8"));
verifyBundle(bundle, { issuerKeys: [loadPublicKey("keys/app.pub")], logFile: "log.jsonl" }).ok;   // true
```

Framework hooks and adapters, including Claude Code, the OpenAI Agents SDK, the Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, OpenClaw, DeepSeek Harness, Hermes and Google ADK, are in [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md). To enforce rather than record, put the gateway between the agent and its tools: `npx agent-custody gateway --config gateway.json`, set up in [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md); between an agent and the agents it delegates to over A2A, `--a2a` serves the gateway as an A2A agent itself. The gateway is listed in the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) as `io.github.svayatta/agent-custody`; its entry is [server.json](server.json), published after each npm release by running the `mcp-registry` workflow from the Actions tab (GitHub OIDC, no token).

## How it fits together

```

Three parties hold keys. The **principal** signs a grant saying which agent may use which tools until when. The **issuer**, gateway or SDK, signs every receipt and every tree head. The **verifier** holds only public keys and needs no access to the issuer, the agent, or the upstream system.

## Two producers, one receipt

| | gateway | SDK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| where it runs | separate process between agent and tools | inside the agent's process |
| what it sees | MCP tool calls | whatever the framework's hooks expose |
| enforcement | yes, denied calls never reach upstream | only where a hook can block |
| provenance of its fields | `attested` and `observed` | `claimed`, all of them |
| what a verifier learns | the agent could not skip or forge this | the agent's process reported this and it has not changed since |
| install | one line in the host's MCP config | a hook entry or a wrapped function |

Every receipt names its issuer, and the verifier prints what that issuer kind is worth before anything else. A dashboard full of `sdk` rows is the reason to route the consequential calls through the gateway.

### Supported hosts and frameworks

| host or framework | producer | enforce + record | record only | tested against |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| any MCP host: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, custom | gateway | yes | | a real MCP client and upstream over stdio |
| Claude Code | SDK | `hook` command, PreToolUse deny | PostToolUse | the documented hook contract, via stdin |
| Claude Agent SDK | SDK | `claudeAgentHooks` | same | the same handler |
| OpenAI Agents SDK (JS) | SDK | `wrapTools` | `observeRunner` | a real `Runner` with a scripted model |
| Vercel AI SDK | SDK | `wrapTools` | | a real `generateText` loop over the SDK's mock model |
| LangChain / LangGraph (JS) | SDK | `tool(issuer.wrap(fn))` | `ReceiptCallbackHandler` | real `StructuredTool` invocations |
| OpenClaw | SDK | `registerOpenClaw` / `openclawHooks`: `before_tool_call` deny | `after_tool_call` | OpenClaw's documented hook contract, in the plugin's process |
| DeepSeek Harness | SDK | the module is the plugin: `tools/pre-execute` deny | `tools/post-execute` | the harness's tool waterfall types, driven as the harness drives them |
| Hermes Agent | sidecar + [Python package](../python/README.md) | `agent_custody.hermes`: `pre_tool_call` block | `post_tool_call` | the documented hook contract, against a live sidecar |
| Google ADK | sidecar + [Python package](../python/README.md) | `adk_callbacks`: `before_tool_callback` skips | `after_tool_callback` | the real package, ADK's runner with a scripted model |
| anything else | SDK | `issuer.wrap(name, fn)` | `issuer.record` | plain functions |
| Python: LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, Claude Agent SDK | sidecar + [Python package](../python/README.md) | `wrap_tools` (OpenAI Agents, CrewAI), `claude_hook` PreToolUse deny, `client.wrap` | `ReceiptCallbackHandler` | the real Python packages, receipts checked by this verifier |
| Go, Java, Rust, any language with HTTP | sidecar | decide then record | record | [examples/languages](examples/languages), each run against a live sidecar |
| any MCP host in any language: Claude Agent SDK Python, OpenAI Agents Python | gateway | yes | | the gateway is an MCP server; [usage.md](docs/usage.md#python-hosts) |
| any REST API, as tools the agent reaches through the gateway | gateway, `rest` upstream | yes | | a stand-in HTTP API; [usage.md](docs/usage.md#setup-step-by-step) |
| any agent reached over A2A (Google ADK `RemoteA2aAgent`, or any A2A client) | gateway, `a2a` upstream and `gateway --a2a` | yes | | stand-in A2A agents in both wire formats; ADK's own `to_a2a` and `RemoteA2aAgent` in the Python suite; [usage.md](docs/usage.md#the-gateway-as-an-a2a-agent) |

The framework packages are optional peer dependencies. Each adapter imports only from its own package.

## One tool call, end to end

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Gateway
    participant Upstream as Upstream MCP server
    participant Log as Merkle log

    Agent->>Gateway: tools/call stripe.refund {customer_id, amount}
    Gateway->>Gateway: tool in signed grant's scopes?
    Gateway->>Upstream: tools/call customer.lookup {customer_id}
    Upstream-->>Gateway: {verified: true}
    Note over Gateway: facts.customer = that result, labelled "observed"
    Gateway->>Gateway: Cedar: permit if amount ≤ limit and facts.customer.verified
    alt allow
        Gateway->>Upstream: tools/call stripe.refund {customer_id, amount}
        Upstream-->>Gateway: {refund_id, status}
    else deny
        Note over Gateway: no upstream call is made
    end
    Gateway->>Gateway: build in-toto statement, sign (DSSE, Ed25519)
    Gateway->>Log: append canonical envelope
    Log-->>Gateway: leaf index, inclusion proof, root
    Gateway->>Gateway: sign tree head, write bundle to receipts/
    Gateway-->>Agent: result or denial, _meta["agent-custody/receipt"] = id
```

Denied calls get receipts too. "The agent tried to pay out funds and was refused" is evidence worth keeping.

## Anatomy of a receipt bundle

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    B["receipt bundle (one JSON file)"]
    B --> E["envelope: DSSE, signed by gateway key"]
    B --> T["treeHead: DSSE, signed by gateway key<br/>{treeSize, rootHash, timestamp}"]
    B --> I["inclusion: {leafIndex, treeSize, hashes[]}"]
    E --> S["in-toto Statement v1"]
    S --> SU["subject: tool-call:&lt;tool&gt;:&lt;id&gt;<br/>digest = sha256(args)"]

    PR --> P3["args, model id, session<br/><b>claimed</b>: agent-supplied, unchecked (both)<br/>every field, when issued by the sdk"]
```

Every field carries a provenance label. This is the design decision that matters most, and it is what a verifier reads back.

| provenance | meaning | today's examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attested` | signed by a key other than the issuer's | principal id, agent id, the delegation grant (gateway receipts) |
| `observed` | the issuer obtained it deterministically, outside the agent's control | upstream tool results, fact lookups, the policy decision, execution status (gateway receipts) |
| `claimed` | originated from the agent, the model, or the agent's own process, no independent check | tool arguments, the model id, session ids, and every field of an SDK receipt |

## Quick start

```bash
bun install                              # from the repository root, once for the workspace
cd packages/receipts
node scripts/demo.ts                     # gateway: keys, grant, policy, four tool calls, verification, a tampering attempt; then the SDK wrapping the same tool
node examples/01-keys-and-signing.ts     # first of twenty-five step-by-step examples, see docs/tutorials.md
bun run test                             # this package; `bun run test` at the root runs every package
```

Everything runs on plain Node 22 or later. No build step, no `npx`, no `tsx` needed on the command line.

The demo leaves everything in `demo-out/`, including receipts from both producers. Verify a receipt by hand:

```bash
node src/cli.ts verify demo-out/receipts/<id>.json \
  --issuer-key demo-out/keys/gateway.pub \
  --principal-key demo-out/keys/principal.pub \
  --log demo-out/log.jsonl
```

Exit code 0 means every check passed. See [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md) for what the report means.

To issue receipts from your own agent code, without a gateway:

```ts
import { loadSdkConfig } from "./src/config.ts";
import { createSdkIssuer } from "./src/sdk/index.ts";

const issuer = createSdkIssuer(loadSdkConfig("./sdk.json"));
const refund = issuer.wrap("stripe.refund", async (args: { amount: number }) => stripe.refund(args));
```

[docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) has the config file and the per-framework adapters.

## What a receipt proves, and what it does not

| claim | verifier | adversary | mechanism | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| receipt was not altered after issue | anyone | later editor | DSSE signature over canonical JSON | done |
| receipt was issued in sequence, none removed | auditor with a log copy | operator rewriting history | Merkle inclusion proof + recomputed root | done |
| the principal really delegated this scope to this agent | anyone with the principal's key | operator, agent | grant signed by principal key, checked for scope and validity window | done |
| the policy decision was made against this exact policy | anyone | operator swapping policies | sha256 of policy text in the receipt | done |
| facts the policy relied on were not asserted by the agent | anyone reading the receipt | agent | facts fetched by the gateway, recorded with their own digests, labelled `observed` | done |
| the side effect was committed to the log before it happened | anyone with a log copy | operator, log outage | for tools in `precommit`, a signed authorization logged first, embedded in the receipt with its leaf position, checked to precede the receipt | done |
| the upstream system actually executed the action | anyone with the upstream's key or the provider's secret | operator | the upstream signs its result for the receipt, or the provider's own delivery signature (Stripe, GitHub) is embedded and checked | done, for upstreams that sign |
| the operator itself cannot mint a false receipt | regulator, counterparty | operator | needs a TEE-hosted signer or a federated log | **not done** |
| which model produced the call | anyone | operator | no hosted provider signs model identity | **not possible today**, labelled `claimed` |
| an SDK receipt reflects what the tool really did | anyone | agent's own process | none; the SDK shares a process with the agent | **by design not claimed**; issuer kind `sdk` says so |

If a vendor tells you their receipts prove more than the first five rows, ask them which key signed it.

## Plan

The design is two producers feeding one verifier. The SDK is the top of the funnel: cheap to install, wide reach, honest about being self-reported. The gateway is what a security or compliance owner mandates for consequential actions. Both exist; the work is widening each.

**Done**

- Gateway: MCP proxy, signed delegation, gateway-fetched facts, Cedar policy, denial receipts, Merkle log, offline verifier.
- Receipt schema carries the issuer kind, so a verifier reads gateway versus SDK before anything else.
- SDK core: policy decision, record, and a generic `wrap(tool, fn)` for any framework whose tools are functions.
- Claude Code command hook for PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and PostToolUseFailure, with blocking on deny.
- Claude Agent SDK in-process hooks over the same handler.
- Provider-native deliveries: an upstream wrapping Stripe or GitHub attaches the signed webhook or delivery for the call; a verifier with the shared secret checks the HMAC, the timestamp, and the binding to the result, and reports the execution as attested by shared secret.
- Logarithmic appends: the Merkle log caches complete subtrees, so issuing a receipt costs the same at the millionth leaf as at the first; measured at 0.15 ms per receipt and about half a millisecond per gateway call including policy, a fact lookup, and the upstream signature. A remote log adds one network round trip plus about five milliseconds of server work per call, two for a pre-committed call; the [deployment guide](https://agent-custody.dev/guide/deployment) has the measurements against the live log.
- Retention on the log: `prune` replaces leaves older than a cutoff with their hashes and removes their bundles, so proofs still verify and the content is gone.
- Several upstreams under one gateway and one grant, each tool owned by exactly one, with the receipt naming which served the call; consumed facts flow across them.
- Attested execution: an upstream that holds a key signs its result for the receipt, the gateway embeds it, and a verifier given the upstream key reports the execution as attested rather than observed. The memory server and the demo upstream sign.
- HTTP upstreams: the gateway reaches an already-running MCP server over Streamable HTTP with a bearer token from the environment, as well as spawning one over stdio.
- Optional fact lookups: a lookup that references a call argument the call does not carry is skipped rather than denying, so policy can see the fact a write is about to supersede without refusing writes that supersede nothing.
- Consumed facts: an upstream declares the facts it served in its result `_meta`, and every later gateway receipt in the session carries those ids as `consumed`, observed, so what the agent had been shown before each call is on the record.
- The forwarded call carries the receipt id and the attested agent and principal in `_meta`, so a stateful upstream can cite the receipt; the memory server in `@agent-custody/state` runs this way.
- Conformance vectors, generated by the test suite and published with the spec, and a browser verifier on agent-custody.dev that passes all of them.
- Sidecar: the SDK issuer behind a local HTTP API (`serve`), with a Python package on PyPI-ready footing and Go, Java, and Rust clients, so agents in any language get the same receipts from one signing implementation.
- Consistency proofs between tree heads (RFC 9162), served by the log and checked by the `audit` command, so an auditor holding an old tree head can prove nothing before it was rewritten.
- Remote log: the issuer can append to a log run by someone else over HTTP, whose key then signs the tree heads, so a verifier learns the receipt was in a log the operator could not rewrite. Includes the reference log server, bearer-token auth, and a root endpoint for auditors.
- Framework adapters, each tested against the real package with a scripted model and no network: OpenAI Agents SDK (`wrapTools` enforces, `observeRunner` records from lifecycle events), Vercel AI SDK (`wrapTools` over a real `generateText` loop), LangChain (`ReceiptCallbackHandler` records, `issuer.wrap` enforces).

- Plans and the tenant portal: every tenant is on a plan (free, ten thousand appends a month; team, a million; enterprise, no allowance) enforced at append with a clear 429; the portal at the operator's `PORTAL_HOST` lets a team register, get its tenant and first key, watch usage against the plan, mint and revoke keys, buy the team plan through Stripe, and copy the export command, with every action in the audit trail.
- An audit trail of administrative actions: every tenant created or disabled and every token minted or revoked is recorded with who did it, from the admin page or the command line, shown on the page and carried in the tenant's export.
- A tenant's export: `log-export` takes, with the tenant's own token, every leaf hash, the signed head, the published keys, the checkpoints, and their usage, checks that they add up, and writes a log copy the verifier reads offline; the evidence never depends on the operator staying in business.
- Monitoring and metering: `log-check`, the outside probe that verifies the head, the checkpoints, and the witness and exits 1 on trouble, run every ten minutes by the `monitor` workflow; `GET /health`; and usage per tenant per month on the admin page and as CSV.
- The witness: a second signer on a machine the log's operator does not control countersigns each checkpoint after proving it extends the last one it signed, refuses a rewritten or forked history with an alarm, and publishes its key; `audit --witness-url` requires it. Phase 6 of [issue #6](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/6).
- The signer, keys, and checkpoints: the key in its own process (`signer`, `--signer-url`), the key document at `/.well-known/agent-custody-log.json` fetched and pinned by `verify --log-url` and `audit --log-url`, and signed checkpoints per log published to a directory and a table for a verifier who was not watching. Phase 3 of [issue #6](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/6).
- The log over Postgres: `log --db-env`, leaves as hashes in one table keyed by tenant, one writer per tenant by advisory lock, tenants and hashed tokens in tables managed by `log-admin`, rate limits and a body cap, retries in the sink, and `import` for an existing file log. Phase 2 of [issue #6](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/6).
- A log for someone else: `hashOnly` sends leaf hashes so the log never holds a receipt; the reference server runs several tenant logs at `/t/<tenant>/` with their own tokens and ids; tree heads name their log and the verifier checks it with `--log-id`. Phase 1 of the hosted log, [issue #6](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/6).
- OpenTelemetry export: with `otel` in either config, every receipt is also one span at the collector the team already runs, trace id equal to the receipt id, attributes for tool, agent, principal, status, decision, and log position; after the receipt, best effort, never on the evidence path.
- Delegation chains for sub-agents: a grant that names the agent's key lets it delegate a narrower grant, with the parent embedded, up to three deep; the verifier and the gateway walk the chain to the principal, refusing any link that escalates scope, widens the window, changes the principal, or is signed by the wrong key; the receipt names the sub-agent and the principal and carries the chain. Pinned by the `gateway-chain-*` vectors and mirrored in the browser verifier.
- One gateway for many agents: `gateway --http` serves the gateway over Streamable HTTP, one session per connection under the grant that connection presents, sessions sharing the upstreams and the policy and nothing else; a platform team runs one gateway in front of the tools instead of one process per agent.
- Splunk export: with `splunk` in either config, every receipt is also one event at the HTTP Event Collector, with the receipt id, tool, agent, principal, status, decision, and log position as searchable fields and the token from the environment; the same best-effort rule.
- The REST connector: a plain HTTP API described as tools in the gateway config, credentials from the environment, so an agent's direct API calls become receipted, policy-checked tool calls through the gateway.
- Pre-commit authorization for consequential tools: named in `precommit`, a call is signed and logged before it is forwarded, withheld if the log will not take it, and its receipt carries the committed authorization with proof that it precedes the execution.
- Agent-to-agent delegation under custody: the A2A upstream and the gateway's A2A front; receipts per delegation with the delegate's card as a fact. A Google ADK `RemoteA2aAgent`, or any A2A client, is pointed at the gateway and a refused delegation comes back as a rejected task the delegate never saw. The delegate does not yet countersign its answer; the receipt attests what the gateway sent and observed, not what the delegate did with it.

**Next, in the order it pays off**

1. Run the witness for log.agent-custody.dev on a machine and under an account that is not ours, and require it in the welcome sheet. The code is done; what it needs is a second operator. [Issue #6](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/6).
2. Post-quantum signatures: ML-DSA beside Ed25519 in the same DSSE envelope, hybrid by default when a PQ key is present, in every signed artefact and in the browser verifier. [Issue #11](https://github.com/svayatta/agent-custody/issues/11).
3. Receiver attestation for agent-to-agent calls: the delegate signs its answer for the receipt, as a signing upstream does today.
4. A TEE-hosted signer, then SD-JWT redaction, then ZK proofs of policy compliance. Not before.

A Python SDK follows the same shape once the TypeScript adapters have settled.
